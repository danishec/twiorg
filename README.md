# Twiorg

Twiorg is a story format for [Twine 2](http://twinery.org/2) that exports to the [Org](https://https://orgmode.org/) format.

It is inspired by [Twison](https://github.com/lazerwalker/twison/), a useful format that exports a Twine 2 story to JSON. 

## Installation

From the Twine 2 story select add a story format, and point it to the url (https://cdn.githubraw.com/danishec/twiorg/v0.3.0/dist/format.js)
